# How to Join the Closed-Preview Cohort

We’re running a *tiny* pilot so we can give every volunteer decent mentor time.  
If you can spare ~1 hour / week for 4-6 weeks, here’s the process:

1. **Check the skills list**

   | Area | We need at least… |
   |------|-------------------|
   | *Bioinfo* | R / Python, basic scRNA-seq QC |
   | *ML* | familiarity with graph/Boolean models |
   | *Docs / Outreach* | Markdown + Git basics |

2. **Open a “Request Preview Access” Issue**

   Click **`New Issue` → “Request Preview Access”** and fill in:
   - A short bio (2 – 3 sentences)  
   - Relevant links (GitHub, ORCID, etc.)  
   - What you’d like to work on  
   - Approx. weekly availability

3. **We send a private-repo invite**

   We batch-process requests every few days.  
   If accepted, you’ll receive:
   - A GitHub invite to the private repo  
   - A brief onboarding checklist (readme, 5-min toy run)

4. **One-week familiarisation**

   - Clone the repo, run the toy pipeline locally  
   - Note questions / pain points in the `#onboarding` discussion

5. **30-min cohort call**

   After a week we host a short Zoom to:
   - Answer questions  
   - Match volunteers to small tasks  
   - Clarify timelines & expectations

After the pilot stabilises, we’ll merge everything back to this public repo.

### **FAQ**

**Q — Is there funding or is this purely volunteer?**  
Right now it’s passion-driven. Small cloud-credit stipends are planned.

**Q — Can I share results publicly?**  
Please keep code/data private until we flip the main repo public.
