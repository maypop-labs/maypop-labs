Below is a “shopping list” of possibilities that, when taken together, would give the biggest immediate win.  They are group by what they add, withe notes regarding the key software and how each could drop into—or replace—pieces of the current R workflow.

### 1  Sharper trajectory & driver inference

| Why it matters                                | Paper / package                                                | Quick payoff                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RNA-velocity that is actually biophysical** | **cell2fate** (Bayesian, analytic linearization) ([Nature][1]) | Swap‐in for scVelo/velocyto to get more stable velocity streams, then feed its posterior transition matrix into Monocle3’s graph‐learned manifold. |
| **Mutual-information driver hunt**            | **scMINER** (C++ backend, R/Python API) ([Nature][2])          | MI scores uncover hidden TFs in each branch; pipe into your GRN Boolean perturbation screen instead of raw correlation.                            |
| **Generative pseudotime**                     | **scEGOT** (probabilistic latent ODE)                          | Good for bifurcations—re-infers the branch that splits young vs. old keratinocytes with clear uncertainty estimates.                               |
| **Hierarchy-aware clustering**                | **CHOIR** (random-forest significance tests)                   | Replace the ad-hoc resolution sweep in Seurat v5; keeps only cell types with statistical support before building trajectories.                     |
| **Sparse enhancer→gene links**                | **scMultiMap** (joint latent-variable model) ([Nature][3])     | Add a cis-reg layer so Boolean perturbations can test regulatory elements, not just coding genes.                                                  |

**Drop-in note:** scMINER, CHOIR and scEGOT all export h5ad/rds; wrap them in **reticulate** to keep the rest of the R pipeline intact.

### 2  Foundational representation learning (LLM-style for cells & genes)

| Model                                                                                         | Scale                                                                                                                                                     | What you’d use it for |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **CellFM** (foundation model trained on Perturb-seq + virtual KO extrapolation) ([Nature][4]) | Predict transcriptional effect of *untested* gene combinations—feed those predictions into your double-perturb Boolean screen to prioritise wet-lab work. |                       |
| **scPRINT** (50 M cells; gene-network pre-training) ([Nature][5])                             | Instantly returns a directed interaction graph you can seed into the Boolean attractor model, replacing GENIE3/ARACNe.                                    |                       |
| **C2S-Scale** (Google’s open LLM for single-cell “sentences”) ([Google Research][6])          | Fine-tune on your skin dataset to get embeddings that unify transcriptome + metadata; great for federated learning with external cohorts.                 |                       |
| **Multimodal foundation models** (Nature perspective) ([Nature][7])                           | Road-map for expanding to spatial, proteomic & epigenetic inputs—aligns with your “general complex-system” ambition.                                      |                       |
| **scNET** (dual-view GNN integrating PPI + expression)                                        | Use as an encoder before Boolean logic; attention scores often highlight druggable hubs.                                                                  |                       |

Most are PyTorch; deploy via **torch for R** or separate micro-service.

---

### 3  Multi-omics & missing-view completion

* **Tri-omic 3D epigenome + transcriptome atlas** ([Nature][8]) – gives matched Hi-C / ATAC / RNA for mouse aging brain; perfect reference for age-coupled chromatin rewiring.
* **LEOPARD** (longitudinal multi-omics imputer)  – fills in missing modalities/time points so your longitudinal skin data look “complete” to downstream models.
* **scMultiSim** (simulator spanning RNA, ATAC, velocity, spatial) ([Nature][9]) – generate truth-known testbeds to benchmark every new module before it hits production.

---

### 4  Perturb-seq & genotype-phenotype mapping

* **Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)** ([Nature][10]) – protocol blueprint for whole-organism CRISPRi + scRNA; adapt for *ex vivo* human skin equivalents.
* **Single-cell resolved genotype-phenotype map**  – demonstrates pooled CRISPR + environmental stress; a template for your “drug × gene” screens.
* **TRADE** (transcriptome-wide impact estimator) ([Nature][11]) – detects subtle trans effects you’d miss with edgeR/DESeq2; integrates cleanly as an R function.

---

### 5  Network science for *any* complex system (bio → society)

| Concept                                 | Bio paper      | Cross-domain utility                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hypergraph reconstruction via SINDy** | ([Nature][12]) | Learns higher-order (k-body) interactions; applies equally to gene-triads **or** triadic social influence.                  |
| **Network renormalization review**      |                | Shows how to coarse-grain without losing critical dynamics—exactly the scaling tool you’ll need for the civilization model. |

Both come with Python reference implementations; port critical pieces with **Rcpp**.

---

### 6  Quality-control & interpretation safeguards

* **Metabolites-are-not-genes (Nat Metab)** ([Nature][13]) – a must-read before integrating your C. elegans SILAC/metabolomics; prevents pathway-analysis overreach.

---

## Practical next steps (1-month sprint)

| Week | Action                                                                                                                      |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Containerise **cell2fate**, **scMINER**, **scEGOT**; wrap with `{basilisk}` so they run inside R Markdown notebooks.        |
| 2    | Fine-tune **C2S-Scale** on skin dataset (transfer-learn 5 epochs, mixed-precision) and export 128-d embeddings.             |
| 3    | Swap Seurat’s clustering → CHOIR; re-run pseudotime; feed driver list into scPRINT to get GRN prior.                        |
| 4    | Benchmark old vs. new pipeline on **scMultiSim** synthetic sets; target metrics: F1 for driver recovery ↑20%, runtime ↓30%. |

Deliverables double as **startup IP assets** and talking points in accelerator pitches (“we operate on foundation-model scale, yet close the loop with Bayesian velocity & information-theoretic driver discovery”).

### Long-range vision tie-in

The hypergraph/renormalization duo lets you lift the whole Boolean-attractor logic into domains where the “genes” are policy levers or economic indicators.  Drop the same SINDy inference into macro-economic time-series, then project onto coarse-grained attractor basins à la network renormalization.  The theoretical backbone is now peer-reviewed—handy when you pitch the civilization-trajectory project to philanthropies.
